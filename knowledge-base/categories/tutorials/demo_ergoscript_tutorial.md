# ErgoScript Demo Tutorial

This is a demo tutorial for testing the knowledge base ingestion system.

## What is ErgoScript?

ErgoScript is a powerful smart contract language for the Ergo blockchain.
It enables secure and efficient decentralized applications.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple ErgoScript contract:

```ergoscript
{
  val threshold = 1000
  sigmaProp(HEIGHT > threshold)
}
```

This contract allows spending only after a certain blockchain height.

## Key Features

- Non-Turing complete for security
- Cryptographic operations built-in
- UTXO model support
- Zero-knowledge proof integration

## Next Steps

1. Learn about box model
2. Understand sigma propositions
3. Practice with examples
4. Build your first dApp
